# Pokemon Info App

A standalone single-page application (SPA) for viewing Pokemon information, powered by the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

## Features

- **Standalone**: No server-side dependencies or installation required.
- **Direct API Integration**: Fetches data directly from PokeAPI using browser-native `fetch`.
- **Cyberpunk UI**: Modern, responsive interface with a terminal-inspired aesthetic.

## Usage

Simply open `pokemon_standalone.html` in any modern web browser.

1. Locate `pokemon_standalone.html` in the project directory.
2. Double-click the file or drag it into your browser.
3. Enter a Pokemon name (e.g., "pikachu") and click "Show Pokemon Info".

## Development

The application is contained entirely within `pokemon_standalone.html`. It uses:
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with custom properties and animations)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

No build tools or package managers are necessary.
